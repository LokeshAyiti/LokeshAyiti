# Hey there! 👋 I'm Lokesh

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I'm a passionate **Full-Stack Developer** with a strong focus on **Backend Engineering** and cloud technologies.

## 🚀 What I Do

I build robust, scalable applications from the ground up. While I love crafting clean, responsive frontends, my real passion lies in architecting solid backend systems that can handle real-world challenges.

**Frontend Skills:**
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- Creating responsive, user-friendly interfaces

**Backend & Cloud:**
- **Azure** - My go-to for cloud solutions and scalable architecture
- **AWS** - Building and deploying production-ready applications
- API development, microservices, and database design
- DevOps and CI/CD pipelines

## 📊 Current Focus

I'm diving deep into **Trading & Sentiment Analysis** - combining my technical skills with financial markets to build intelligent trading systems. It's fascinating how data patterns can reveal market sentiment!

## 🌱 Always Learning

The tech world never stops evolving, and neither do I. Currently expanding my knowledge in:
- Advanced cloud architecture patterns
- Machine learning for financial markets
- Modern backend frameworks and tools

## 🤝 Let's Connect!

I'm always excited to collaborate on interesting projects, especially if they involve:
- Backend system design

## 💡 Fun Fact

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me analyzing market trends or exploring new technologies. I believe the best solutions come from understanding both the technical and business sides of a problem.
